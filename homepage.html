        <pre>This is a simple basic calculator with memory functions similar to a small 
handheld calculator. Use this basic calculator for math with addition, subtraction,
division and multiplication. Memory and clear functions for this standard calculator 
are listed below.

            mc = Memory Clear
            m+ = Memory Plus
            m- = Memory Minus
            mr = Memory Recall
            CE = Clear Entry
            AC = All Clear
            √x = Square Root
            +/- = Plus/Minus
            π = Pi
            x² = Square:
            R2 = Round to 2 Decimals
            R0 = Round to 0 Decimals
            % = Percent
Delete/Backspace --> deletes one character at a time from the right end of the 
display.The calculator memory is at 0 until you hit m+ or m-. Each time you 
hit m+ the number on the display is added to thenumber in the calculator memory.
Each time you hit m- the number on the display is subtracted from the number in 
the calculator memory. To recall the number in the calculator memory hit mr.</pre></section>

        <p style="font-size:110%; color:white">Theoretically, a modern computer is a calculator that works with binary numbers and has a much larger memory. 
            But in the practical sense, a computer is far more than a mere calculator, because of the wide variety of non-computational tasks it can perform.</p>
